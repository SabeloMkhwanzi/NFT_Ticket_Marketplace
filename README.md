#### Basic Sample Hardhat Setup

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

### TicketVast - NFT Ticketing Marketplace

### Project Description

- The NFT Ticketing Marketplace upload the ticket on the IPFS. Hash is calculated by IPFS and tickets get stored on the database. NFT tickets are created and uploaded to the requested NFT marketplace.

- Ticket owners can also resell NFT tickets on the NFT marketplace. The ticket is stored in a smart contract. Once a buyer buys the ticket, the smart contract triggers and the payment is sent to the seller automatically..

### Project Concept

- NFTs are unique digital tokens stored on the blockchain. Once they are created on the blockchain, they can be sold to customers digitally. Customers then store NFTs in a secure wallet that can be accessed on any device.
In the ticketing system, event organizers can mint the required number of NFT tickets on their choice of a blockchain platform. They can code the NFTs to set a sale price or run the sale as an auction where people can start a bid for tickets
